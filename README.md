# Calculator

String calculator that uses pre-defined delimiters of ',' and '\n' as well as custom delimiters.

Works in accordance to these requirements: https://github.com/restaurant365/challenge-calculator

The only stretch goal implemented is 2.

Implemented using test driven development.

I'm making the assumption that we will always support the delimiters of ',' and '\n'
in every formula, even if the formula has a custom delimiter.
